# aTech Media Libraries & Utilities

This plugin/gem includes a number of useful libraries and gems which we use in a number
of our applications. This repository is an attempt to keep all this information together.

Feel free to use anything you find in here in your own projects.

## Rails application template

This library includes a Rails template generator which carries out a number of useful
things to get you started with your application.

    rails new [application] -m https://github.com/atech/atech/raw/master/rails/template.rb

Take a look [here](http://github.com/atech/atech/blob/master/rails/template.rb) to see
exactly what things it does.
